NoRandomOculus

With patch 3.3 the daily dungeon quest will be replaced with a random daily from the LFG system. The LFG system assigns every group a random dungeon. It tries to avoid assigning you a dungeon where you already have an ID.

This add-on automatically extend your Oculus instance ID whenever you log in on your characters and therefore make it less likely that you will get Oculus assigned.

If you would like to run Oculus, you can always cancel the raid extension. The add-on only extends it upon logging, you can remove the lock afterwards.
